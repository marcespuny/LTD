				London Trading Exchange and Clearing Group Ltd. and Commercial Universe Singapore Pte Ltd do not represent that the information in these web pages is comprehensive, complete or accurate and exclude liability for any consequence resulting from acting upon the contents of this or another site, in so far as no wilful violation of obligations took place or, as the case may be, no injury to life, health or body arises or claims resulting from the Product Liability Act are affected.<br/><br/>
				
				Securities traded on the London Trading are currently not available for offer, sale or trading in the United States nor may they be offered, sold or traded by persons to whom US tax laws apply. <br/><br/>
				
				The fund shares listed in LTX Funds and Shares ETF are admitted for trading on the London Trading Exchange.

				<font color="#162938"><b> References and Links </b></font><br/><br/>
				
				With regard to direct or indirect references to other Internet pages ('links') that are beyond the scope of the author’s responsibility, a liability obligation only applies if the content of such pages was known to the author, and if it is reasonable and technically possible for the author to prevent their use in the case of illegal content. As such, the author expressly states that no illegal content could be identified on the linked sites at the time when the links were created.<br/><br/>
				
				The author has no control over either the current and future design, or the content of the linked/referenced sites. The author therefore dissociates him/herself expressly from all content on all linked/referenced pages which was modified after the link was created. <br/><br/>
				
				This statement applies to all links and references created within the author’s own website, as well as to third-party entries in mailing lists set up by the author. The liability for illegal, incorrect, or incomplete content, and especially for damages resulting from the use or non-use of such information provided, rests solely with the provider of the page to which the link leads, and not with the person who established the link. <br/><br/>

				<font color="#162938"><b> Liability</b></font><br/><br/>
